# Lab Name
solidity2chaincode

# Short Description
This tool converts Solidity contract into Javascript chaincode through source-to-source translation for running them onto Hyperledger Fabric.

# Scope of Lab
The purpose of the lab is to perform a source-to-source translation of Solidity contracts into Javascript chaincode for running them into Hyperledger Fabric.

# sol2fab

Sol2fab is a tool for translating Solidity contracts into Javascript
for Hyperlerger Fabric.


# To run the tool:

Make sure you have already installed node on your computer.

Step 1: Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solidity2chaincode.git`


Step 2: Install dependent packages

```
cd src
npm install
```

Step 3: Translate a Solidity contract (we will translate EIP20)

```
node app.js ../Examples/Example#15/EIP20.sol
``` 

The following files are generated. The chain code file is `EIP20/test.js`. A balance chaincode file is also generated.
```
.
./EIP20
./EIP20/test.js
./EIP20/package.json
./balance
./balance/package.json
./balance/balance.js
./README.md
```

Step 4:

Follow instructions on this page to test invocations of EIP20 contract in Ethereum Remix and translated chaincode.

# Fabric version supported

Fabric 1.3

# Status of the project
It is still in development phase. Approximately, 70-75% of Solidity keywords have translated. In particular, the following examples are covered:
